# iherma02.github.io

1. All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. index.html, resume.html, and bio.html reflect the requirements of the project spec. They are hosted in the iherma02.github.io repo of my GitHub account. I used Git constantly throughout the project, committing & pushing changes with meaningful messages. My CSS files includes at least 5 rules. All pages pass the official HTML5/CSS validation. In addition, there is a separate index.html page hosted in my tufts CS account that can be viewed at http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~iherma02/. I did not use JS, jQuery, or another front-end framework, nor did I use any site generators.

2. I did not collaborate on or discuss the assignment with anyone.

3. I spent approximately 3-4 total hours working on this assignment.
